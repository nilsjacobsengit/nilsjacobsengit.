Hi, my name is Nils and I'm currently a student at UofA cyber operations program. I currently live in Oslo, Norway and that's where I'll take my online classes from.
I'm very interested in learning more about programming and all the uses I can get out of it, I've never really been the best programmer but I'm trying to get better by working on side projects, like digitalising neuropsych tests for some friends, and getting used to coding on a daily basis.
Right now, my favourite hobbies are between video games and skiing. Norway has a 6 month skiing season so I make the most of it. I also really enjoy traveling and look forward to visiting more of Asia and South America.
